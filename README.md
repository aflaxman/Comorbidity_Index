# Comorbidity Index
Comorbidity means multiple disease diagnosis for a patient. In EHR data, usually each patient at each encounter will have one primary diagnosis as well as several other non-primary diagnoses. The co-exist of such multiple disease diagnoses is called comorbidity. 

There are serveral ways to calculate the comorbidity index such as Charlson Comorbidity index, Elixhauser Comorbidity index and NCI Comorbidity Index. This python package is designed to calculate those comorbidity index.
